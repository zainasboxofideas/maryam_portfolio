        Iâ€™m an aspiring computer scientist with a passion for problem-solving, programming, and creative design. Currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Jahangirnagar University, I thrive at the intersection of technology and innovation.

        My journey includes developing software projects like chatbots and dietary planners, mentoring students in programming, and contributing to initiatives that combine technology and social impact. Whether it's exploring algorithms, mastering new frameworks, or designing user-friendly applications, I'm always eager to grow and make an impact.

        Feel free to connect if you'd like to collaborate on exciting projects or share ideas! ðŸ˜Š
